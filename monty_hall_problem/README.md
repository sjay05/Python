## Demonstration of the Monty Hall Problem

This is a small python experimental implementation of the Monty-Hall-Problem. Here is a quick
description of the problem:

_The **Monty Hall** problem is a **probability** puzzle, based on an American Television show named after
the host; Monty Hall. Suppose you are in a game show and the host gives you a choice to pick one of
three doors. Behind one of the doors is the **prize** (suppose a car) and behind the others; **goats**.
You start by picking a door, say **No. 1** and the host who knows what's behind the doors, opens another
door, say **No. 3** which contains a goat. He then says "Do you wish to pick door **No. 2**?". Our goal is
to find out whether it is an advantage to switch our choice or retain to the door we originally
picked. I used the **randomization** function to implement this game in programming._

For more details about the problem refer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)

`There is a prize inside one of the 3 doors. Your goal is to guess the correct door number to recieve the prize.
 Choose a door number(0, 1, 2): 0
 We will reveal one of the doors...
 ['x', 'x', 'goat']
 Do you wish to change your choice?(Y or N): Y
 Congratulations! You won
 Do you wish to play again?(Y or N): Y
 Choose a door number(0, 1, 2): 1

 ['goat', 'x', 'x']
