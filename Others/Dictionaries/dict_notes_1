A dictionary is like a list except that there association between the key and a value. This is called a key-value pair
or an item. The function 'dict' creates a new dictionary with no items. '{}' represent an empty dictionary.
"""

#Here is an example dictionary that converts English to Spanish

>>> eng2sp = dict()
>>> eng2sp
{}

#To add items you can use square brackets:

>>> eng2sp['one'] = 'uno'

#This line creates an item that maps from the key 'one' to the value 'uno'. If we print the dictionary we see:

>>> eng2sp
{'one', 'uno'}

#You can also use the output format as a input format. For example:

>>> eng2sp = {'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three': 'tres'}

#But if you print it the order it shows up can be unpredictable and might not always match the same order you inputed in.

>>> eng2sp
{'one': 'uno', 'three': 'tres', 'two': 'dos'}

#But since this is not a list we don't have to rely on the index to find our value.
#We can always use the keys to looking up corresponding values.

>>> eng2sp['two']
'dos'

#But we can only search up values that are in the dictionary

>>> eng2sp['four']
KeyError: 'four'

#The len function also works on dictionaries

>>> len(eng2sp)
3

#The in function only works on keys and not values

>>> 'one' in eng2sp
True

>>> 'uno' in eng2sp
False

#But if you want to search up keys you can do this:

>>> vals = eng2sp.values()
>>> 'uno' in vals
True
